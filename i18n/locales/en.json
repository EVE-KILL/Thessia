    "faq.description": "Discover comprehensive answers to common questions about our platform, features, and services to enhance your EVE-KILL experience",
    "faq.items.icons.label": "How do ship icons work?",
    "faq.items.icons.content": "Ship icons are dynamically retrieved from the official EVE Online API in real-time, ensuring accurate and up-to-date visual representations alongside killmails and detailed ship information throughout our platform.",
    "faq.items.killmail.label": "What is a killmail?",
    "faq.items.killmail.content": "A Killmail is a comprehensive data record generated by EVE Online whenever a ship is destroyed in combat. This detailed report captures essential information including the victim's identity, all participating attackers, destroyed and dropped items, damage statistics, and precise location details—providing a complete picture of the engagement.",
    "faq.items.killmails.label": "How are kills processed?",
    "faq.items.killmails.content": "Our advanced queueing system processes killmails with maximum efficiency, prioritizing speed and accuracy. Once processed, killmails are instantly broadcast via websockets for real-time display on the site, ensuring you always have the latest combat data. All processed killmails are simultaneously made available through our comprehensive API for developers and third-party applications.",
    "faq.items.api.label": "Do you offer an API?",
    "faq.items.api.content": "Yes, we offer a robust and well-documented API that provides programmatic access to our extensive killmail database and analytics. Developers can access comprehensive endpoints for killmails, statistics, and related game data through our API documentation at <a target='_blank' href='{swaggerLink}'>/swagger</a> or <a target='_blank' href='{scalarLink}'>/scalar</a>, enabling seamless integration with third-party tools and applications.",
    "faq.items.donations.label": "Donations?",
    "faq.items.donations.content": "Yes, we welcome contributions through our <a target='_blank' href='{donateLink}'>Support page</a> for those who wish to help sustain and enhance our services. While donations are entirely optional and will never be required to access our platform, they directly support ongoing development, server costs, and new features. We sincerely appreciate any level of support from our community.",
    "faq.items.ads.label": "Ads? Tracking?",
    "faq.items.ads.content": "We are firmly committed to providing a clean, distraction-free experience. Our platform will never feature intrusive advertisements or implement user tracking systems. We believe in respecting your privacy and maintaining the integrity of our service without compromising the user experience through advertising.",
    "faq.items.account.label": "Do I need an account?",
    "faq.items.account.content": "No, you don't need an account to access and browse our comprehensive killboard data. However, creating an account unlocks enhanced features such as posting comments, creating campaigns, and personalizing your experience. When logging in through EVE SSO, you maintain full control over which permissions you grant—we operate on a principle of minimal necessary access. While the killmail scope is recommended for optimal functionality and is selected by default, you have complete freedom to customize your authorization preferences.",
    "faq.items.contact.label": "How can I contact support?",
    "faq.items.contact.content": "Our support team is readily accessible through our active <a target='_blank' href='{discordLink}'>Discord community</a>, where you can engage directly with both our team and fellow users. For technical inquiries, feature requests, or bug reports, our <a target='_blank' href='{githubLink}'>GitHub repository</a> provides a structured platform for detailed discussions and issue tracking.",
